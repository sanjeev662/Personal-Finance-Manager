    1. Simplify expense tracking for individuals and organizations.

    2. Provide detailed insights into spending patterns to enable better financial management.

    3. Offer a platform for users to create, update, and delete expenses and categories.

    4. Generate comprehensive reports based on user-defined time periods and categories.

## Features

    Implement authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and middleware to protect endpoints.

- Database:

    Store all data, including user information, expense entries, and categories, in MongoDB, a NoSQL database.

    Implement Mongoose ORM for schema definition and validation.

- Deployment:

    Deploy the application to a cloud provider like AWS and render.
    frontend has deployed on AWS and backend on Render.

    Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated builds and deployments.
